## What is bost?
   A very simple "host" implementation by Avraham Lembke <blambi@chebab.com>
   It is not meant to be a full host replacement etc just translate hostname
   to a IP.
   
   One good think on how its implemented is that it follows all the
   normal libc lookup's etc for your system so you can use it to test
   NSS or other configuration that changes your DNS lookups.

## Where to get it or contact the author?
   you can get it at http://blambi.chebab.com/software/bost/
   And I'm contactable at blambi@chebab.com

## Note on ranges
   By choice the ranges are limited to a maximum of /24

## Usage?

   For a single host

   `$ bost host`

   For an IP address:
   `$ bost 10.0.0.1`

   or
   
   `$ bost 2001:6b0:17:f0a0::b3`

   For N hosts
   
   `$ bost host1 ... hostN`

   For a subnet/range
   
   `$ bost 192.168.0.0/24`
  
   Another range
   
   `$ bost 192.168.0.0/32`

   Its simple..
   But there is currently no range support for IPv6 addresses.

    current options are:
      -h, --help     Show help
      -d, --double   enable double check
     
      for example "bost -d foo" would output both the ip(s) of foo
      and the hostname(s) for the ip(s).
